# VisionEye

The project "TutorialProject" is just a very basic implementation of Unity's Netcode. What it basically does is to allow us to create multiplayer applications. At this moment, in order to run this project, first you need to start the project and click to "Host" button. Then start another one and click to "Client" button. These two applications can run in a synchronized manner. 

The project now allows multiple local users, however the ability to connect through the network will be added as well.
